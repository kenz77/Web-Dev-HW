<h3><span>Reviews</span></h3>
Lisa Johnson: "Poetry is a great style of writing to
include in bedtime or anytime reading, and this is a
classic source. I find I'm trying to cut myself off to
keep their bedtime, and
end up reading 5 more with them. The sawtoothed snail that
lives up children's noses worried my daughter (who's a
nose picker), but was easily recovered. This book is good
for adults too."<br></br>
Everson McDaniels: "Yes! It is one of the best anthologies
of poetry ever written. And, while I would sooner
recommend Skipping Across The Rainbow Sea by KT Iversen
for younger children, anything by Shel Silverstein is
worthy of reading by those 13 and older!"</div>
