  <h3>Part 1</h3>
  1. I am going to do a book showcase. <br>
  2. I chose the book, Where the Sidewalk ends by Shel Silverstein. <br> Here is my writing sample: <br>
</br>
  The Edge of The World
  <br></br>
  Columbus said the world was round?<br>
  Don't you believe a word of that.<br>
  For I've been down to the edge of the world,<br>
  Sat on the edge where the wild wind whirled,<br>
  peeked over the ledge where the blue smoke curls,<br>
  And I can tell you, boys and girls,<br>
  The world is FLAT!
<br></br>  3. This author is very talented. He wrote several books of prose and poetry. He also writes songs, draws cartoon, sings, and plays guitar. <br>
  <br></br>
  4. Here is my color pallette:

  5. Here is an ispirational image from the front cover of the book:<br></br>

<h3>Part 2</h3>
For this part of the project I did a lot of thinking about the design and layout for my site. I picked out two fonts that should fit nicely together, Ubuntu and DancingScipt. I still really like the color pallette I chose and think it would be great for a children's site. I don't think I will want to use all of those colors though. I as likely going to leave out the sage green. The almond oil color looks like it could be a good subtle background color. and the Gray color used for text.
I seemed to have some issues with using color. I followed the directions and it didn't always work. I did the background color fine but doing text color didn't work so well.
