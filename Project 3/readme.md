  <h3>Part 1</h3>
  1. I am going to do a book showcase. <br>
  2. I chose the book, Where the Sidewalk ends by Shel Silverstein. <br> Here is my writing sample: <br>
</br>
  The Edge of The World
  <br></br>
  Columbus said the world was round?<br>
  Don't you believe a word of that.<br>
  For I've been down to the edge of the world,<br>
  Sat on the edge where the wild wind whirled,<br>
  peeked over the ledge where the blue smoke curls,<br>
  And I can tell you, boys and girls,<br>
  The world is FLAT!
<br></br>  3. This author is very talented. He wrote several books of prose and poetry. He also writes songs, draws cartoon, sings, and plays guitar. <br>
  <br></br>
  4. Here is my color pallette:
