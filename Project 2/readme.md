<H2>My Struggles With Part One of Project 2:</H2>
<body>
Still trying to get used to working with markdown. I can memorize some of them but not all. I had troubles getting this from Atom to Github for some reason and it took me the longest to figure it out, but I was just making a simple stupid mistake. Guess I forgot to turn my brain on. </body>
<H2> How I Accomplished This Assignment</H2>
<body>
Coding has always been a struggle for me so I did have to use the markdown cheatsheet for a lot of this. The reason I had trouble getting my index.html onto Github is because I forgot to save this to my file first so then it wouldn't show up there and I was really confused, but I thought it through and finally figured it out... Stress panick over silly mistakes makes me angry.

<H1>Part 2</H1>
<H2>Struggles:</H2>
<body>
This week I had a few technical issues that I needed to fix. Just easy changes here and there for the most part. The forms.html was a little more confusing, but I worked that out. </body>
<H2>Accomplishments:</H2>
<body>
I emailed for help when I couldn't seem to figure out the solution on my own. That helped me a lot and I got everything figured out after that. So glad my professor checks her email on the weekends. </body>

<H1>Part 3</H1>
<body> This week I struggeled to get things done on time because of all the homework I was assigned this week and having to study hard for an exam I had, But coding is starting to get a little easier which is great. Still not a fan of it, but I am happy when I am able to successfully accomplish something I was struggling with. </body>
