  <p> The materials I use for this instructable are <thead>
  the easiest materials I have used when making pinch pots.
    This is good for beginners who are not very
    familiar with working with clay.
  </p><p>  Even if you are not an art major or have an
    art studio of your own, this is a fun and easy
    project that you can do in your own home. I
    highly recommend this activity to be added to
    your to-do list.

</p><p> This is just a small, simple project that I have
  done. I am also into making oil painting, drawing with
  charcoal, and printmaking. I have also done more
  advanced pottery such as making a 6 foot pot out of
  red clay and I am currently working on wheele
  throwing which is really hard at first, but once
  you get the hang of it is a lot of fun. This is
  an art worth learning.
