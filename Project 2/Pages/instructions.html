        <td>Cup the ball in your hand. Next, gently
          press your thumb into the center of the ball
          to create an opening. Leave at least 3/8 of
          an inch (1 centimeter) of clay at the bottom
          to form the base of the pot.</td>

           on the sides at the same rate. Keep
           pinching until the walls are as thin as
           you’d like them. Smooth out any cracks in the clay
           with your fingers after you’ve finished
           forming the pot.</td>

           the pot is leather hard, it will be cool to
       the touch and firm like a block of cheese.</td>
