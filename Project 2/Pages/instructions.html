        <td>Cup the ball in your hand. Next, gently
          press your thumb into the center of the ball
          to create an opening. Leave at least 3/8 of
          an inch (1 centimeter) of clay at the bottom
          to form the base of the pot.</td>

        <th>Step 3</th>
<td></td>
        <td>Use gentle pinching motions to thin out the
           walls of the pot. Work in circles to thin
           out the sides at the same rate. Keep
           pinching until the walls are as thin as
           you’d like them. The walls of the pot should
           be similar in thickness without any large
           divots.[5] Smooth out any cracks in the clay
           with your fingers after you’ve finished
           forming the pot.</td>

        <th>Step 4</th>

        <td>Set the pot in a low-traffic location and
          cover it with a lightweight hand towel. When
           the pot is leather hard, it will be cool to
       the touch and firm like a block of cheese.</td>

        <td>Refer to your package of clay to see what
          temperature to set your oven to. Once your
          oven has preheated to the right temperature,
         place your pottery on a baking sheet and put
       it in your oven. Refer to the manufacturer
       instructions for cooking times.</td>
