        Welcome to my art page! </p> <p>
        All the ceramic art you see here was made by hand and each piece is
        unique. These are up for sale if you would like to purchase any of these.
        I also am up to suggestions if you have anything you would like me to make
        for you. Personalized items are also an option.
