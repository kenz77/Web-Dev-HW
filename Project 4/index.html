        Welcome to my art page! </p> <p>
        All the ceramic art you see here was made by hand and each piece is
        unique. These are up for sale if you would like to purchase any of these.
        I also am up to suggestions if you have anything you would like me to make
        for you. Personalized items are also an option.

<p>Responsive Web Design:<br></br>
RWD is used so a website can be easily viewed on any size screen whether you use a phone, tablet, or computer monitor.
This is important because it helps the viewers access your information more easily and is also more visually interesting. So
if you are trying to attract more attention to your website, this would be the way to go. Flexbox is suitable for RWD because
those boxes adapt automatically to the size of the screen. Wireframes are also helpfull for helping with the layout of the site.
